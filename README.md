# Rest Client Project

This was Microverse's second collaborative project in the Rails' course. The goal was to use [rest-client gem](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client) to create a [Bing](https://www.bing.com/) search (really? Bing?) and examine the results.

## Link to assignment

The assignment can be found in the Odin Project's Ruby on Rails course that can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/let-s-get-building).
